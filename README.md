# Image Editing App


Building a RESTFUL API with NODE, pure Raw MongoDB query on  cropper.js 

Here I have added Functionality of ``Cropper.js`` library for Cropping Image Files.After Cropping Image will get store in uploads folder.

For Uploading Image I have used to  ``multer`` Dependency from npm.

For Listing Data I have used Jquery DataTables plugin as Server Side Rendering Tables Using Ajax Call.

Added Chosen Select Jquery plugin for AutoSearch Select Boxes which is very User friendly 

Used Server side Template Engine as pug

Added Searching Functionality using Jquery.

Implementation Remaining for Adding Image Filters Such as Caman JS or Any other plugin (Pending)

Now is a good time to seque into some tooling that will make things much easier when developing Node applications. 
``Nodemon`` is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
